# ML-For-Medicine
Here I have my numerous machine learning in medicine/healthcare projects.
Each code example here has been done in Keras and/or Sklearn due to simplicity and ease of implementation, HTML links to data sources have been included at the top so you may run these programs effectively and play around with them on your own (Note: The convolutional neural network has been set up to use the spyder working directory).
